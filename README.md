# Make It Green API

This is the API for Make it Green - an AI app that takes in repices and turns them vegan 🌱

The idea for this project came about when I decided to start trying to eat more plant-based meals for health, environment and wallet reasons! The problem i kept running into is that, as a total foodie, Ikept getting these fabulous recipes in my inbox that were decidedly not part of the plant-based diet I was going for.

Rather than making all the substitutions mentally, I figured "why not use AI to do some of the heavy lifting for me?" and that's how this project was born 😊

## Installation

This app uses Node and Express on the backend and React on the frontend. Backend and frontend are in their own separate folders.

To install, from root, 
<!--

Illustrations: A picture is worth 1000 words, right? Got a video of your project or a GIF of it working? Perhaps a link to a live demo? Is your application something you can show? Don't be too quick to say "No" here. Terminal applications are ok, and the app doesn't have to be pretty or even interactive.

Scope of Functionality: What does your project do? Equally important, what does it not do? List out anything that you know is missing (e.g. Slack clone has no support for file attachments).

Known Bugs: Keeping a bug log may seem like a bad idea since it highlights that you have bugs in your code, but this is a great thing for employers to see. 

Prerequisites: If you include the installation section below, be sure to list prerequisites and assumed dependencies here (Homebrew, Python3, etc).

Installation: If it's possible to install and run locally with minimal effort, include installation instructions. Don't be the person that says "try out my code" with no clear way of doing so. Don't forget examples of how to run it, along with any necessary configuration changes!

Commands to Run Tests: Every good developer has tests for their bigger personal projects. Be sure to include testing and add information on how to run tests in the ReadMe.

Technologies Used: What was your stack? Why did you go with that stack? It's ok to say that you were just wanting to learn cool technology!

Pointing to the "cool" stuff: Got a lot of boiler-plate code for the project? Don't make employers guess. Directly link in the ReadMe to the cool stuff you implemented.

Credits: Did you build off of another cool project idea? Do the right thing and link to their repo and give them credit. It doesn't make you less hirable. -->
